A year ago today, I was not doing anything in particular.

When I say I wasn't doing anything, I really mean that. My youngest child had just turned 9, I was only working part-time running my internet retail store, and I found myself faced with the spectre of 40 with no practical work skills. You see, like many families, my husband and I had decided that I would be a stay-at-home mom. I completely agreed with this, and in fact if I were to do it again I would make that same choice. But it was a choice that left me sitting at my desk, realizing my kids were old enough that I could invest in myself, and having no idea where to start that investment.

My husband suggested I learn some Python. He himself is a software engineer via electrical engineering, working exclusively with Python, and so it seemed like an obvious vector for me to explore. I bought several books and did several projects, but they all went nowhere. I wasn't actually DOING anything, and I didn't know where to go with what I was learning. Learning Python for no reason felt like learning any foreign language for no reason. It's all well and good to have an enrichment goal, but without a greater purpose for practice, you're just shouting "Hello World!" into the void, whether it's in French or in code. I enjoyed what I was learning, but could see no greater purpose.

In the spring, changes hit the world, and even more so for me. My husband and I separated, and things flew into disarray. More than ever I needed to look forward into the future and find a path that would lead to both employment and, preferably, fulfilment. I started looking into my options. Did I need to go back to school for a master's? I had a degree in Business Administration, but that promise had gone unfulfilled. My husband and I had married right out of college, and rather than utilizing my degree, I went a more romantic (and ultimately impractical) route of art until we had our children and decided I would stay home. Despite my schooling I had absolutely zero work experience, so the degree counted for little more than an entrance checkbox into a higher level program.

I searched and found out about boot camps. I had no presumptions that such things were a magic pill, but I knew it was something that could be done in my own time, which was important as a part-time single parent in a Covid world where my kids themselves no longer went into school. Discovering boot camps was eye opening.

But I still didn't know what I wanted to do with myself. There were a lot of choices. I was attached to Python and didn't want to switch to another language. I could see the potential of software development, but it didn't speak to me. I didn't really understand what data science encompassed, and I simply assumed it was too technical for me (which is just a form of imposter syndrome).

Months passed. I had a new partner. He himself was a data scientist, and had quickly observed my fondness for spreadsheets and creating order and meaning from chaos. He suggested it as a path for me to look into. I did some research, and told him with an amusing story about when my ex-husband and I had sold a rental house several years prior, and the rudimentary spreadsheets I had made trying to predict what we could sell for. "That's data science," my partner said. "You just didn't know that you were doing it." 

I took the introductory course, and I was hooked. Here, I could make order out of chaos. I could take all of this information that I see all around me and organize it and use it to explain the world. The possibilities feel endless. I knew this was exactly where I wanted to be.

And I am here, in the program, and loving every moment. I only wish I had known sooner. But I hope it's never too late.
