The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability exercise that sometimes confuses even those who understand and know it well. Check out this simple visual explanation that even your kids will understand.

So here we are on a game show. There are three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You get to pick one door, and you get the prize behind the door. Some silly people, like my kids, think the goat sounds great - but let's assume we want to get the car.

It's very easy to understand that when we pick one door, our chance of picking a car is 1 in 3.

We can prepare for the rest of the problem by remembering that all possible choices add up to a 100% chance of "something" happening, in this case, getting a prize. So in our simple first choice, we have a 1/3 chance of a car + a 2/3 chance of a goat = 100% chance of getting a prize. Easy, right? 

So now we've picked our first door. There are two doors that we didn't pick. So we are one of three possible paths, even if we don't know WHICH path. We don't know what our first choice was - but I'll show you in a moment why that doesn't matter.

If we picked a car, the other two doors have goats. If we picked a goat, the other two doors have a goat and a car.

Now we move on to the brain teaser part. The host is going to open one of the doors we didn't pick, and offer to let us switch doors. In the game show, he always shows a goat. Here's what that looks like on our decision tree.

Here is the key to the problem. Our decision tree has fundamentally changed in the middle of the problem. Our choices have actually been reduced from three choices to two choices. Where before we had a potential path with three choices, there are now only actually two choices - keep our first choice, or switch.

As we already know, *all possible choices add up to a 100% chance of something happening*. And our original 1 in 3 chance of picking a car hasn't changed. But look - you can easily see that our chance of getting a car if we SWITCH has  changed.

Our chance of getting a car if we switch is now 2 in 3. **Switching is always the correct choice in the Monty Hall problem**
